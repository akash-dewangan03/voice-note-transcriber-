# Voice Note Transcriber ðŸ”‰ðŸ’¬

**Voice Note Transcriber** is a web application built using **Streamlit** that allows users to upload audio files (in `wav` or `mp3` format), transcribe them into text, and generate concise summaries. The app uses the **AssemblyAI API** for transcription and **Hugging Face's BART model** for text summarization. Users can download the full transcription and summary in `.txt` or `.docx` formats.
